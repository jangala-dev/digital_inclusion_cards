# digital_inclusion_cards
A deck of cards to be used for digital inclusion research projects

## What are digital inclusion cards?

Each card is the name of a type of activity we do online. These cards are designed for in-person engagement. You could use them for community facilitation, research, an explorative game - it’s up to you. 

You could use them to help understand what is important to people, what makes them nervous, or what they want to learn. 

## Why have you made them?

We made the cards to help us do research interviews with people who use Jangala technology to get online. 

We find using cards to talk about being online helps people relax, feel comfortable and share. It can also help people feel more empowered to focus a conversation on what is important to them. 

In research this is called a participatory method. This is about giving power to the people we are talking to, and enabling them to lead and collaborate in research. 

This video explains a bit more.

And here’s a blog which outlines how we used them. 

We would love to be inspired by how you use the cards. Find us on LinkedIn, Instagram or Bluesky and tell us about it. Or email info@janga.la. 

## **How can I get access to the cards?**

You’ll need access to a printer and some scissors.

- Download the pdf file
- Print onto A4 paper (make sure your printer settings are set to ‘Fit to paper’ and ‘One sided’)
- Cut out each card
- If you want to laminate them, you can
- Print extra blank cards, if you like

## **How do I use the cards?**

It’s really up to you. You can lay the cards out, or give them to participants as a deck to sort through. You might want to ask people about things they do online, want to do, or never do. Or you could encourage people to order them according to how important they are. 

Sharing our online lives can be sensitive. People are sometimes embarrassed about what they can or cannot do. We found making throw-away piles can help people relax if there’s things they haven’t tried or feel nervous about doing. 

Sometimes, we gave people half the deck to sort, and then the second half, so it wasn’t overwhelming. 

## **Are the cards accessible?**

We have tried to make them accessible by using large card sizes, large font and icons. There is also a black and white version which might suit some users better. 

If you see something that could be improved for accessibility, do let us know on info@janga.la.

## **Can I access the cards in other languages?**

So far, we have only released a version in English. But if you want to translate them, we would love to see it. Please see the licensing terms below. 

## **Do I have to pay?**

Nope. These are free for you to use. Please mention Jangala if you’re producing research or presentations, or posting online about them.

## **How did you choose the categories?**

The categories are the types of activities that digitally excluded people might recognise and relate to. They were developed by Jangala as part of our research with people who are digitally excluded. We made changes to the cards, based on what we learned from using them. 

The idea builds on previous research by Kat Dixon, our Impact and Advocacy Lead, such as The Periodic Table of Internet Elements. 

It was interesting and challenging building the categories because if the categories are too broad, users may not engage. But if the categories are too narrow, there are too many cards to be useful. You can read more about the process of creating the cards here.

## **There are things people do online that don’t fit into these categories. What gives?**

Good spot! There are so many things we do online. There’s no way we could make cards that comprehensively cover everything we do. The blank cards at the back are there so people can write their own. Feel free to print off extra copies of the back page, if it helps.

Remember the categories are imperfect. The cards are about starting a conversation and letting users lead the way. 

## **Do you have a digital version?**

No. Currently these are only made for print. We created them to have conversations with people who are digitally excluded in an in-person setting. 

## **Do I have to use them in a research setting?**

Not at all. These are to be used however you want, in community engagement, learning sessions or for play. It’s really up to you. 

## **Can I use these cards in a commercial setting?**

Yes. Please credit Jangala and see the licensing terms below. We hope they are useful to you. 

## **Can I use these for quantitative card sorting?**

We haven’t designed them for quantitative card sorting, so the categories may not work well. Feel free to iterate the cards, using the licensing terms below. 

## **What does the licensing mean?**

The license means these cards are free to download, print and use however you want. Please mention Jangala if you write a report or post on social media about them.
